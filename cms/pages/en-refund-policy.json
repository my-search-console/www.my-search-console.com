To do so, simply go to your profile page and click on the unsubscribe button. With a few clicks, you will no longer be charged monthly.\n\nHowever, you will not be reimbursed for the last remaining days. For example, if you unsubscribe on the 15th of the month, you will have 15 days left to take advantage of your subscription, then it will be suspended and you will no longer benefit from all its advantages."
