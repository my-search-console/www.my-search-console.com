This is because they often require server-side rendering (SSR) or pre-rendering to transform the JavaScript into static HTML, which can be resource-intensive for indexing robots. <br> **Crawl Budget consumption**: The \"Crawl Budget\" refers to the amount of resources a search engine is willing to spend to index a site. JavaScript-heavy sites can consume a disproportionate share of this budget, which can negatively impact the indexing of other important parts of the site. By restricting access to non-essential JavaScript files via robots.txt, it is possible to manage this crawl budget more effectively. <br> **Impact on indexing**: Blocking certain JavaScript files in robots.txt can make sense if these files don't contribute significantly to the user experience or the site's main content. This can allow search engines to focus on the main content and improve indexing efficiency. <br> So it's important to strike a balance between not blocking scripts that are essential to the site's functionality or content, while limiting access to less important JavaScript resources to optimize crawl budget and indexing efficiency.","issues/modal/error/title/robots/empty":"Your robots.txt is empty","issues/modal/error/description/robots/empty":"Your robots.txt file is empty.

HTTPS encrypts data between a user's browser and the server, making the site more secure. This is particularly critical for sites handling sensitive information. Users are more likely to trust and use a secure site, and search engines like Google favor secure websites in their rankings.  Second, HTTPS is a ranking signal for search engines. Since 2014, Google has been using HTTPS as a factor in its ranking algorithms. Websites with HTTPS are more likely to rank higher in search results than non-HTTPS sites. This is part of Google's effort to ensure a safer web.  Third, HTTPS preserves referral data. When traffic moves from a secure HTTPS site to a non-secure HTTP site, referral data is often lost, causing the traffic to appear as \"direct\" in analytics. This can lead to a misunderstanding of where traffic is coming from. HTTPS maintains this referral data, providing a more accurate picture of traffic sources.  Lastly, faster performance and improved user experience are often associated with HTTPS, due to the implementation of HTTP/2, which requires an SSL certificate (part of HTTPS). Faster websites are favored in SEO rankings and are more appealing to users.","issues/modal/error/title/server/not-sc-domain/not-same-url":"Your website is not the same in Search Console","issues/modal/error/description/server/not-sc-domain/not-same-url":"Your website has been registered in the Search Console with an incorrect URL. It is crucial to enter the correct URL in the Search Console to prevent GoogleBot from crawling inappropriate or non-existent pages, such as 301 (redirects) or 404 (not found) errors. This ensures proper and efficient indexing of your site by search engines.","issues/modal/error/title/server/not-sc-domain":"You have not added your site with the sc-domain","issues/modal/error/description/server/not-sc-domain":"By adding your site using the sc-domain method, you will benefit from better control, easier setup, and more reliable integration with third-party services.","issues/modal/error/title/server/no-index":"Your home page has no-index tag","issues/modal/error/description/server/no-index":"The homepage of the website has a \"no-index\" tag. This is a serious issue because the \"no-index\" tag instructs search engines like Google not to index the page in their search results. Since the homepage is typically the most important page, serving as the primary gateway to the rest of the website, having a \"no-index\" tag on it means that the homepage won't appear in search engine results. This can significantly reduce the site's visibility, organic traffic, and potentially impact its overall credibility and effectiveness in reaching its target audience. For a website looking to attract traffic and engage with users, ensuring that the homepage is indexed is crucial for its success.","issues/modal/error/title/sitemap/no-sitemap":"The sitemap has not been added to the Search Console","issues/modal/error/description/sitemap/no-sitemap":"A sitemap is important because it helps search engines efficiently crawl and index your website, ensuring that all your pages, especially new and updated content, are discovered quickly.

This metadata includes information such as the last time the page was updated, how often it changes, and its importance relative to other pages on your site. The XML sitemap should adhere to the protocol established by search engines, which includes using specific tags like <urlset>, <url>, <loc>, <lastmod>, <changefreq>, and <priority>. The format should be clean and follow a hierarchical structure to ensure that search engines can easily read and understand the content and structure of your website. Additionally, for larger websites, sitemaps can be split into multiple files, and a sitemap index file can be used to organize these sitemaps. This helps in managing the sitemap more efficiently and ensures faster processing by search engines.","issues/modal/error/title/sitemap/contains-external-url":"Your sitemap contains external urls","issues/modal/error/description/sitemap/contains-external-url":"Your sitemap should exclusively list pages directly from your website.
